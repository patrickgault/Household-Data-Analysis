# Household Data Analysis
This repository includes Python scripts to explore geocoded household survey data with latitude/longitude coordinates. It was written for use with Esri ArcGIS Desktop 10.3.1 and a national scale household survey dataset, such as the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS). There are scripts for data setup, Cluster and Outlier Analyses, Empirical Bayesian Kriging, and Geographically Weighted Regression.

## Requirements
1) Basic understanding of geostatistical analysis  
2) Esri ArcGIS Desktop Spatial Analyst and Geostatistical Extensions  
3) ArcPy Site Package  
4) Household Survey data with latitude longitude coordinates and an area of interest polygon  

Note: I created this as my final project for a class called Programming for Geospatial Applications but it supports that work that I am doing professionally.
